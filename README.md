## Overview

This repository is for the design and implementation of a Scenarios forecasting model, built by the Scenarios team within CFA-Predict.

Currently, we aim to use this code to forecast different disease tranmission scenarios with a compartmental mechanistic ODE model.  This model is under development with transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as our primary focus.  We plan to apply this model to the transmission of other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV.  We aim to provide enough flexibility for the code users to explore a variety of scenarios, but also making certain design decisions that allow for fast computation and fitting as well as code readability.

[//]: # (This code aims to combine a number of different codebases to forecast different covid scenarios with a Compartmental Mechanistic ODE model modeling multiple competing covid variants. The aim of this model is to provide enough flexibility for its users to explore a variety of scenarios, but also making certain design decisions that allow for fast computation and fitting as well as code readability.)


What this model is:

a compartmental mechanistic ODE model that accounts for age structure, immunity history, vaccination, immunity waning and multiple variants.

[//]: # (capable of dynamic age binning, waning, vaccination scenarios, introduction of new variants, transmission structures, and timing estimation. TODO)

What this model is not:

A fully dynamic suite of compartment models where any compartment may be easily added or removed. All models have assumptions, the basic compartment structure is assumed in many places, making it non-trivial to change.

## Model Structure

Subject to change, current transmission dynamics follow this basic model

## Quick Start

As a first pass at running model ODEs and inference of parameters, take a look at `example_end_to_end_run.py` to see the process of running our model. You will probably need to `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get started as well.

Within `example_end_to_end_run.py` there is an optional `-infer` flag added from the terminal. This will kick off an example inference on synthetic data generated by the model itself and will produce different output.

To try out your own basic scenarios, check out the `config/` folder, where you can modify parameters within the four base `json` files as you see fit and see their impacts on the model back at `example_end_to_end_run.py`.

If you are interested in understanding how the model is initialized, rather than looking through the model matricies yourself, the Scenarios team has created a Shiny application allowing for easy data visualization of the model's initial state!
Simply run `visualizer_app.py` and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ and play with the data yourself.

## Data Sources

The model (as described in the example script) is fed the following data sources:
1. data/demographic-data/contact_matricies : contact matricies sourced from work done by Dina Minstry's past work in this [Github Project](https://github.com/mobs-lab/mixing-patterns).
2. data/serological-data/* : serology data sourced from: [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/Laboratory-Surveillance/Nationwide-Commercial-Laboratory-Seroprevalence-Su/d2tw-32xv)
3. data/sim_data_*.sqlite: ABM data sourced from Tom Hladish's work found [here](https://github.com/tjhladish/covid-abm)
    1. Data from the SQLITE files is used to generate an `abm_population` csv file. If you wish to use a new ABM to initialize the model, providing a replica schema to that shown below will allow code reuse. Schema for intermediate `abm_population` file : `pid`,`age`,`strains`,`num_doses`,`TSLIE`,`num_infections`, `infectious`.
        1. `pid`: a unique ID number as int
        2. `age`: a integer age of the individual
        3. `strains`: a comma separated string of strain exposure history before the initialization date, in order from oldest to most recent, values must match those in your config file STRAIN_IDX enum.
        4. `num_doses`: number of vaccines given to that individual before the initialization date.
        5. `TSLIE`: (Time Since Last Immunological Event) The number of days since the initialization the last immune event occured, either vaccination or recovery from infection whichever is more recent.
        6. `num_infections`: number of times person has been infected should equal the len(strains)
        7. `infectious`: boolean 1 = person is actively infectious at initialization date, 0 = person is not actively infectious. This could be due to recovery or because they were exposed recently and not yet infectious. Paired with negative TSLIE values to identify exposed compartment.
