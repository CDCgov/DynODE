# cfa-scenarios-model
 
This repository is for the design and implementation of a Scenarios forecasting model, build by the Scenarios team within CFA-Predict.

This code aims to combine a number of different codebases to forecast different covid scenarios in a Compartmental Mechanistic ODE model with multiple competing covid variants.

# Quick Start

In order to run this model and get basic results follow these steps:
1. Todo
2. Todo

# Data Sources

The model is fed the following data sources:
1. data source 1 : used in the following way todo
2. data source 2 : used in the following way todo
