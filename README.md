## Overview

This repository is for the design and implementation of a Scenarios forecasting model, built by the Scenarios team within CFA-Predict.

This code aims to combine a number of different codebases to forecast different covid scenarios with a Compartmental Mechanistic ODE model modeling multiple competing covid variants. The aim of this model is to provide enough flexibility for its users to explore a variety of scenarios, but also making certain design decisions that allow for fast computation and fitting as well as code readability.

What this model is:

a compartmental mechanistic ODE model capible of dynamic age binning, waning, vaccination scenarios, introduction of new variants, transmission structures, and timing estimation. TODO

What this model is not:

A fully dynamic suite of compartment models where any compartment may be easily added or removed. All models have assumptions, the basic compartment structure is assumed in many places, making it non-trivial to change.

## Model Structure

Subject to change, current transmission dynamics follow this basic model

## Quick Start

In order to run this model and get basic results follow these steps:
1. Import your config file, model ode, and `mechanistic_compartments.py`
2. Build a BasicMechanisticModel class with the builder or from scratch.
3. use the `.run` command to run without inference, and `.infer()` to use MCMC to fit some parameter values.

Here is an example script of a basic run of 100 days without inference of parameters, saving the simulation as an image to output/example.png:
```
from model_odes.seir_model_v5 import seirw_ode
from mechanistic_compartments import build_basic_mechanistic_model
from config.config_base import ConfigBase

solution = build_basic_mechanistic_model(ConfigBase()).run(seirw_ode, tf=100.0, show=True, save=True, save_path="output/example.png")
```

To create your own scenario, and modify parameters such as strain R0 and vaccination rate follow these steps:
1. Create a copy of config/config_scenario_template.py and name it whatever you would like.
2. Change `self.SCENARIO_NAME` to describe your new scenario
3. Modify or add any parameters you wish to differ from config/config_base.py
    1. if you wish to add parameters rather than just change them, you will need to pass that parameter to your model, through the `mechanistic_compartments.get_args()` function
4. Pass those parameter changes to the base constructor so it may initalize the rest to default values.
5. Run almost the same script as above, replacing your ConfigBase import with ConfigScenario.

```
from model_odes.seir_model_v5 import seirw_ode
from mechanistic_compartments import build_basic_mechanistic_model
from config.config_scenario_example import ConfigScenario

solution = build_basic_mechanistic_model(ConfigScenario()).run(seirw_ode, tf=100.0, show=True, save=True, save_path="output/example_scenario.png")
```

## Data Sources

The model is fed the following data sources:
1. data/demographic-data/contact_matricies : Dinas contact matricies todo
2. data/serological-data/* : serology data sourced from: [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/Laboratory-Surveillance/Nationwide-Commercial-Laboratory-Seroprevalence-Su/d2tw-32xv)
