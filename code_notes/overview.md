# Overview

DynODE is a library that is actively being used and maintained to produce for
valuable insights and products at CFA. DynODE is also in pretty decent shape
as far as a piece of Python software goes. This makes DynODE an excellent
candidate for investment in time to transform this research code into an API
designed for broader consumption.

Refactoring this code will be no minor undertaking. The refactoring will 
involve many levels of updates, from specific things like style fixes and
updating programming patterns to follow best practices, to fully 
re-imagining the structure of the API. In the end, what we would be targeting is a DynODE v1.0. DynODE is not unique in CFA in terms of being a target
for this type of refactoring, it just happens to be the first. What we learn
and develop here will help to inform what is done with other code resources.
