DynODE API Documentation
========================

/* Below API Documentation Description TBD /*

This repository is for the design and implementation of the DynODE framework for disease Scenario forecasting, built by the Scenarios team within CFA-Predict.

Currently, we aim to use this code to forecast different disease tranmission scenarios with a compartmental mechanistic ODE model.
We aim to provide enough flexibility for the code users to explore a variety of scenarios, but also making certain design decisions that allow for fast computation and fitting as well as code readability.
